# A few common drivers
This library provides drivers, to support effect/action execution in the context of a reactive 
application implemented with =component combinators.

# Documentation
The current documentation exists :

- [Action driver](http://brucou.github.io/projects/component-combinators/actiondriver/)
- [Query driver](http://brucou.github.io/projects/component-combinators/querydriver/)

The document driver as of now only inject the global `document` object in the `sources` object. 
Any existing documentation applying to that object is hence relevant, and as such we provide none
 for it.

# Installation

# Test
Not much in term of tests. Just tested the umd build in a browser environment (open the relevant 
`index.html` in a local web server).

Open an issue with your idea.

# Known issues
